# letterboxdYearComparison


This project consists of 3 parts, with the overall goal being to get a better understanding of how I watch and rate movies.
This data comes from letterboxd, a film-diary app where users can rate films that they have seen.

Part 1: I create graphs comparing the number of films watched each year and then the rating distributions for each year
Part 2: I calculate summary statistics for film ratings for each year
Part 3: I create a new file with only the movies at or above the 3rd quartile, named topratedmovies.csv

Next steps: I used topratedmovies.csv on my Random Movie Suggestions project (also on github) so I would have a data set with the highest rated movies to use.
In the future: I hope to use these scripts as backbone for future analyses as I watch more movies and expand the inputted data set.
